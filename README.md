# Welcome to the zoo
This app was created using javascript and an Ajax call to the Giphy API to view animal images and html form elements to add animals to the list of options to view.

## Instructions
Click on a button to load still imagaes of that animal from the giphy API.

Click on an image to watch the animation. If you click again on the same image, the animation will stop, returning to the original still image.

You can also add your own animal choices to the list of buttons by filling in the form on the right and clicking submit.
